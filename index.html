<h2>As much as a way of life, <em>Alison P. Hunter</em> is an article of faith.</h2/>
  <p>I am random and mutable assemblage of traits, and yet I find mening in life. Nihlist Arby's Twitter feed
  speaks to this friction well. Please enjoy Tweets form this collection here on my About Me page. </p>



  <h3>Experience</h3>

  <p>In honor of john lennon's <em>return</em> to the void, beat your wife...in a friendly race down to arbys.
Arbys: bigger than Jesus, realer than God. On this, a date that lives in infamy,
surprise your unsuspecting hunger with a tactical, 2 wave Arbys attack. Arbys arbys arbys
We made it out of cows. And when they die get ready. To cram them in your bowels. Have a Hanukkah. Enjoy arbys.</p>

    It's Black Friday. You've laughed at stampeding fat people. You've choked a bitch for an Xbox. Now, hit up Arbys and get ready to die.

  You sit alone in arbys, face shiny with grease and tears. Your family is thankful you're no longer around.
