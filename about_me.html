  <h1>About Me: Alison P. Hunter</h1>

<h2>As much as a way of life, <em>Alison P. Hunter</em> is an article of faith.</h2/>
  <p>Knowing that I am taking this course to learn basic skills and recognizing that I will never pursue
    Front End Web Development specifically, professionally, I have decided to fill these areas with text which
    deviates somewhat from the requirements put forth by Noah. So, instead of "Clearly articulate your skills and
    experience on a landing page", on this page, instead of a primer on
    <em>Alison P. Hunter</em> as a current or future developer, I have pasted quotes from one of my
    favorite surrealist Twitter authors, Nihlist Arby&#39;s.  <a href="https://twitter.com/nihilist_arbys">
      Please enjoy Arby&#39;s.</a>

  <h3>But What does this mean?</h3>

<div class= "emphasis">

  <p>In honor of john lennon's return to the void, beat your wife...in a friendly race down to arbys.
Arbys: bigger than Jesus, realer than God. On this, a date that lives in infamy,
surprise your unsuspecting hunger with a tactical, 2 wave Arbys attack. Arbys arbys arbys
We made it out of cows. And when they die get ready. To cram them in your bowels. Have a Hanukkah.
Enjoy arbys.</p>

  <h4>In the Moment, nobody knows what <em>is</em> and what <em>is not</em> Relevant Experience</h4>

    It's Black Friday. You've laughed at stampeding fat people. You've choked a bitch for an Xbox. Now, hit up
    Arbys and get ready to die. Arbys. Who has a case of the Mondays? Come down to arbys &#38; contemplate
    how old you've become &#38; how you've disappointed everyone who once loved you.</li><br>

    Hi. I'm John madden. Soon I'll be dead. You will too. Here's a monstrosity of decadent gluttony that defies
    nature. Tursuckit, God. Eat arbys. That awkward moment when your best friend is a dead sliced up pile of
    bovine flesh and your sentience is an irrelevant fever dream. Eat Arbys</li><br>

  <li>Web Developer, CitiPix 2015 &#151; present<br>
  Today at Arbys, we'll be celebrating back to the future by hurling through time towards the inevitable eternal
  darkness that awaits us all.You sit alone in arbys, face shiny with grease and tears. Your family is
  thankful you're no longer around. Happy thanksgiving from Arbys</li></p><br>
